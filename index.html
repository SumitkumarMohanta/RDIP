    <i> Subhas Chandra Bose &#128512; was an Indian nationalist whose attempt during World War II to rid India of  
British rule with the help of Nazi Germany and Japan left a troubled legacy. 
The honorific Netaji (Hindustani language: "Respected Leader"), first applied to Bose in Germany, 
by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials 
in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin, in early 1942, is now used widely throughout India. -source Wikipedia</i>
